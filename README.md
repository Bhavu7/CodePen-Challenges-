# 🎨 CodePen Challenges Archive

Welcome to the **CodePen Challenges Repository**!  
A curated collection of creative front-end projects crafted for the official [CodePen Weekly Challenges](https://codepen.io/challenges).

This repo showcases bite-sized code art—ranging from micro-interactions to full-blown CSS wizardry—all built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It's where pixel-perfect design meets expressive experimentation.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder in the repo represents a unique challenge, typically named using the pattern:

📂 Challenge-Name/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── README.md (optional)

---

Most challenges are standalone and do **not** require a build step or dependencies—just open `index.html` in your browser and enjoy.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – For the semantic structure
- **CSS3 / SCSS** – For styling and visual magic
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – For interactivity
- Occasionally uses CodePen's built-in preprocessors or utility libraries (like GSAP or Anime.js)

---

## ✨ Live Demos

Each project was originally deployed on CodePen.
